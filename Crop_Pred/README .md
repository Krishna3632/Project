Project Description:

Developed a Crop Prediction System using machine learning to assist farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying the most suitable crop for their fields based on environmental and soil conditions. The model leverages historical and real-time data such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to make accurate predictions.
